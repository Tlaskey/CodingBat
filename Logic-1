Your cell phone rings. Return true if you should answer it. Normally you answer, except in the morning you only answer if it 
is your mom calling. In all cases, if you are asleep, you do not answer. 

answerCell(false, false, false) → true
answerCell(false, false, true) → false
answerCell(true, false, false) → false

//My solution. I'm realizing that it is possible to make this way shorter.

public boolean answerCell(boolean isMorning, boolean isMom, boolean isAsleep) {
    boolean answer = false;
    if(isAsleep == false)
    {
        if(isMorning == true)
        {
            if(isMom == true)
            {
                answer = true;
            }
            else
            {
                answer = false;
            }
        }
        else
        {
            answer = true;
        }
    }
    else
    {
        answer = false;
    }
    
    return answer;
}

//Much shorter version that does the exact same thing. Focuses on using just the variables and not == . Much better solution.

public boolean answerCell(boolean isMorning, boolean isMom, boolean isAsleep) {
    //If you are asleep, it's always false.
    if(isAsleep)
    {
        return false;
    }
    //If it is morning and it isn't your mom you never answer.
    if(isMorning && !isMom)
    {
        return false;
    }
    //For all other cases you do answer.
    return true;
}
